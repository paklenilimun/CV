    <p>My first job in the company was as a CNC operator on a CO2 laser. I went through the necessary training in the
        company and after a few months I was able to operate and work on the machine independently. I worked as a CNC
        laser operator for one year and eight months. After that period, due to exceptional commitment and improvement
        of my knowledge, I moved to the position of CNC programmer for CO2 laser. There I just continued to expand my
        knowledge in the field of CNC machines. Over time, I also mastered the programming of CNC punches, fiber lasers
        and milling machines. I currently have the following knowledge:
        <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li> CO2 and fiber laser operator (manufacturer <a href="https://www.lvdgroup.com/en">LVD Belgium</a>)</li>
        <li> Operator on sheet metal punching machines (manufacturer <a href="https://www.primapower.com/en">Prima
                Power</a> and <a href="https://www.trumpf.cn/en_CN/">Trumpf</a> )</li>
        <li> CNC programmer for lasers and punches. Excellent working knowledge of Lantek Expert, Cadman PL, Tru Tops
            and NC Expert programs.</li>
        <li> CNC programmer for milling machines. Knowledge of working in Solid Cam.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    In addition to these skills, I also know how to work in Solidworks. In 2017, I also completed training in
    programming and operating CNC machining centers at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in Banja Luka. In 2021, I
    also completed the Crestcom management training. I am currently in the position of team leader of CNC programmers
    within the Technical Work Preparation department.

    <h3>My hobbies and interests</h3>
    <p>I have had a love for video games since my early childhood. I like sports simulations and adventure games the
        most. Favorite games include Pro Evolution Soccer, GTA series, Red Dead Redemption series and Uncharted series.
        Besides video games, I like to play soccer and basketball recreationally. I also like to go hiking. He singled
        out climbing on the Vranica mountain and its highest peak, Nadkrstac, which is 2112 meters above sea level, as
        his greatest success. When I have the chance I like to go for a walk. My favorite destinations in Banja Luka are
        Banj Brdo and Suturlija Nature Park. At the very top of Banj hill there is a monument to fallen soldiers.
